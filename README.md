# Low Voltage Distribution Network Design & Load Flow Analysis

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the complete workflow of designing and analyzing a **1000 kVA, 415 V low-voltage distribution network**. The design was developed in **AutoCAD** for single-line diagrams, feeder pillar layouts, protection schemes, and cable sizing. The system was then validated through **ETAP load flow simulations** to ensure efficiency, reliability, and compliance with voltage drop standards.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **AutoCAD**: Single-line diagrams, feeder pillar design, voltage drop calculations, and cable sizing  
- **ETAP**: Load flow analysis, voltage profile verification, transformer loading, and system loss evaluation  

## Key Features  
- Designed a **1000 kVA package unit (11 kV / 0.415 kV transformer)** with **8 feeders** and **20+ loads**  
- Verified **voltage drop ≤ 4%** across all feeders  
- Simulated ETAP load flow showing:  
  - **Bus voltages ≥ 96%**  
  - **Transformer loading at 60.5%** of capacity  
  - **System losses < 3%** of total load  
- Implemented optimized protection scheme with **630 A fuses, 200 A circuit breakers, and CTs (100/5 A)**  
- Improved network reliability, reducing outage risk by **>25%**  

## Repository Contents  
- **/AutoCAD_Files** – Single-line diagrams, feeder pillar schematics, and cable schedules  
- **/ETAP_Files** – Load flow models and simulation results  
- **/Reports** – Design documentation and analysis summaries  

## How to Use  
1. Open the AutoCAD files (`.dwg`) to review the single-line diagram and feeder pillar layout.  
2. Run the ETAP model to simulate load flow and validate performance metrics.  
3. Compare voltage drop calculations and ETAP simulation results for design validation.  

## Results  
- Stable voltage profile across all buses  
- Transformer utilized safely within operational limits  
- Losses maintained under recommended thresholds  
- Fully coordinated protection scheme for enhanced system safety
